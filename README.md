CHORD PROFILES MIDI

A little function that pretends to provide a SIMPLE framework where ALL the binary chord profiles are properly defined.

ALL the chords are shown in 'chords.png' extracted from [1]. The chords appear in the code in the same order as in 'chords.png'.

Written in Matlab.

Examples on how to use the function, see 'example.m'.

TO DO:
- comment.
- program alternative methods for finding the pitch profile.
